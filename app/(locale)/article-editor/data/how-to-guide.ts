# How to Create a Modern Front-End Website
Creating a front-end website nowadays involves using modern frameworks and tools that enhance development efficiency and user experience. In this guide, we will create a simple front-end website using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn 

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project
First, create a new Next.js project. You can use the following command: 

\`
npx
create - next - app
my - website--
typescript\` 

## Step 2: Installing Tailwind CSS
Next, install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies by running the following command: 

\`
npm
install
tailwindcss
postcss
autoprefixer\`

For more information on configuration, check the [Tailwind CSS configuration documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

## Step 3: Adding Tailwind CSS to Your Project
Add the following lines to your **./styles/globals.css** file:

\`
@tailwind
